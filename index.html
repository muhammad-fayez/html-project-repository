        <h3> <p>      Imagine a future in which intelligence is not limited to humans!!! A future where machines can think as well as humans and work with them to create a more exciting world. <br>
            While this future is still far away, artificial intelligence continues to make a lot of progress in these times. There is a lot of research going on in almost all areas of artificial intelligence such as quantum computing, 
            healthcare, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things, robots, etc. <br>
            So much so that there has been a 90% increase in the number of research papers published annually on artificial intelligence since 1996.<br>
            Keeping in mind, if you want to research and write a thesis based on artificial intelligence, there are many sub-themes that you can focus on.  <br>
            Some of these topics are provided with a brief introduction to this article. We also mentioned some published research papers on each of these topics so that you can better understand the search process.<br> </p>

           <br> <h1>  Advantages of Artificial Intelligence </h1> <br>
           <h2>  1. Reduction in Human Error </h2> <br>
            <h3>   One of the biggest advantages of AI is that it can significantly reduce errors and increase accuracy and precision. The decisions taken by AI in every step is decided by information previously gathered and a certain set of algorithms. When programmed properly, these errors can be reduced to null.    </h3> <br>
           <h2>  2. Zero Risks </h2> <br>
                    <h3>   Another big advantage of AI is that humans can overcome many risks by letting AI robots do them for us. Whether it be defusing a bomb, going to space, exploring the deepest parts of oceans, machines with metal bodies are resistant in nature and can survive unfriendly atmospheres. Moreover, they can provide accurate work with greater responsibility and not wear out easily.</h3><br>
           <h2>   3. Digital Assistance</h2> <br>
              <h3>       Almost all the big organizations these days use digital assistants to interact with their customers which significantly minimizes the need for human resources. You can chat with a chatbot and ask them exactly what you need. Some chatbots have become so intelligent these days that you wouldnâ€™t be able to determine whether you are chatting with a chatbot or a human being.
                </h3> <br>
           <h2> 4. New Inventions</h2> <br>
              <h3>  AI has helped in coming up with new inventions in almost every domain to solve complex problems. A recent invention has helped doctors to predict early stages of breast cancer in women using advanced AI-based technologies.  </h3>
