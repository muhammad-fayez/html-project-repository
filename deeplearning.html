                  <br> <h2>  what is deep learning ? </h2>
                  <br> <h3>   Deep learning is one of the foundations of artificial intelligence (AI), and the current interest in deep learning is due in part to the buzz surrounding AI. Deep learning techniques have improved the ability to classify, recognize, detect and describe â€“ in one word, understand.<br>
                 <br> For example, deep learning is used to classify images, recognize speech, detect objects and describe content. Systems such as Siri and Cortana are powered, in part, by deep learning. <br>
                 <br> Several developments are now advancing deep learning:<br>
                 <br>* Algorithmic improvements have boosted the performance of deep learning methods.<br>
                 <br>*New machine learning approaches have improved accuracy of models. <br>
                 <br>*Computational advances of distributed cloud computing and graphics processing units have put incredible computing power at our disposal. This level of computing power is necessary to train deep algorithms.<br>
